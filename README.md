# Multi Object Tracking using OpenCV
Motion capture system (MCS) is frequently used in research and clinical labs to evaluate the motor performance of patients with movement and neurological disorders. However, MCS is an extremely expensive system and patients in the underdeveloped countries cannot get the benefits of the MCS. The development of the low-cost MCS with high fidelity is the key challenge.

## Current version
Tracking multiple objects using OpenCV and save data into cvs file.
Improved it making it run in parallel

## todo
convert 2-D data from serveral videos to 3-D data and plot the 3-D graph.
